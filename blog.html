                    As promised, today I'm proud to announce that Starbuzz
                    Coffee is launching the Tweet Sip cup, a special Starbuzz
                    Coffee cup that tweets each time you take a sip! Check
                    out my video of our new invention.

                    Sound like science fiction?  It's not; I'm already
                    testing our final prototype social network cup as I write this,
                    which links you, the drinker, right to your favorite social
                    networks.  We've made a huge investment to make this happen
                    and we've created a reusable coffee cup complete with RFID,
                    NFC, Bluetooth, and Wifi (not to mention a few more things the tech
                    folks know about, because hey, I'm just the coffee guy).
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, keep your eyes out for this amazing new cup. And I'll
                    be releasing a video teaser soon to tell you all about this
                    new invention, straight from Starbuzz Coffee.

                    Have you ever noticed how efficient a Starbuzz Coffee
                    house is? The lines alway move fast, and despite the
                    astronomical number of different drinks any customer can
                    order, we have your drink up, hot (or cold if that's the
                    way you want it) and ready in seconds. How do we do it?
                </p>
                <p>
                    To pull this off, we take advantage of the latest and
                    greatest in computer science.  In fact, we train
                    our staff to be one big distributed computer.  The cashiers
                    create the orders for the distributed computer, complete
                    with your name and the drinks special instructions.  Then
                    our specialized drink makers grab the next cup
                    and go about working on your order until it's finished.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this design, we are able to horizontally scale our operation
                    any time we want.  All we need to do is add more cashiers
                    and drink makers (not to mention a fair amount of support
                    staff you never see) as the customer flow grows.

                    Our most unique patron of the month award goes to a
                    customer in Poulsbo, Washington, whose daily morning order
                    is a "six-splenda, no-foam, 130-degree non-fat-soy latte,
                    with the splenda stirred in before the milk is added." Do we
                    have unique customers or what?
